The API is RESTful and all data to and from the server will be in JSON with mime type **application/json**.

====== Authorization ======

Requests must contain an **Authorization** header or **authorization** URL parameter.

The value of the Authorization field must be of the form:

siggy-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=**CALCULATED_CREDENTIAL**

The **CALCULATED_CREDENTIAL** is of the form

**API ID** : **TIMESTAMP** : **REQUEST HASH
**

**API ID** is generated by siggy and used as is.
**TIMESTAMP** is the unix timestamp of the request, it must be within 60 minutes of the server time

**REQUEST HASH** is a hash generated for the request. The hash is generated by doing the following:

<code>
stringToHash = RESTVERB + "\n"
             + TIMESTAMP;

$hash = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha256', stringToHash, **API KEY**));
     </code>
